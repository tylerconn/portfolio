                    <p>Once I had settled on the new information architecture for the site, I began creating a low-fidelity prototype in Figma. In addition to updating the navigation, I changed the home page to better reflect some of the desires and needs of the user, Thomas.</p>

                    <p>Next, I began working on a style guide to develop my low-fidelity prototype into a high-fidelity prototype. When choosing my color palette, I decided to keep a few of the main colors (green, blue, gold) from the original site because my goal for this project was not to completely redefine the branding of the government agency and these colors have been long associated with the agency. I also felt that the green would make a great primary color for the site because it associated well with the agency's efforts to promote clean and green energy alternatives.</p>

                    <p>Finally, I tested my high-fidelity prototype for usability with a small group of potential users. The focus of this testing was similar to the testing I did at the very beginning of my project, only now it was using my prototype. I primarily asked the users to attempt two tasks that previous testing showed users having difficulty with, which were: finding information and incentives for alternative fuel vehicles, as well as finding recourses that would help them reduce home energy consumption and costs.</p>
