                <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Background</h3>
                <p>Since the direction of this project was completely up to our team, we started by just listing any ideas we could think of for what we could make our website about. Among the ideas we came up with and discussed was building a platform that could assist with room organization and design, and as a couple of our team members were actually in the process of moving and redecorating, we thought this would be an interesting direction to take the project. We also weren't familiar with any other products or websites that were solving the problem we suspected	existed. Before we got too carried away with designing our product, however, we knew we needed some research to back up our assumptions that a product like this is something users needed.</p>
                <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Who's the User?</h3>
                <p>Once we had settled on the idea of designing and developing a website to help with room organization/design, our team set about trying to understand who would use something like this and what their specific needs would be. We conducted five user interviews and distributed an online survey that received 37 responses. From this research, we learned that the majority of those surveyed rearrange a room at least once a year, with another quarter of respondents rearranging every few years. We also learned that many of our respondents would like to design their spaces better and more frequently, but they don't know where to start and the process seems overwhelming.</p>

                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-end">Affinity Diagram</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>With these insights we created a persona for our user, Edward, who is a real estate agent that spends a lot of time coming up with ideas for how to stage his homes. While we do not anticipate our user base will consist of only realtors, we chose to make our user persona for this project a realtor, because we believed they would be more frequent users and they needs would be more extensive.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>In addition to the user persona, we created an empathy map to help further visualize who our user is and find ways we can help.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Next, we developed a storyboard to explore the user's experience and how we would like our product to fit into that experience.</p>

            </section>
            <section class="mb-5">
                <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">What's the Problem?</h3>
                <p>With these insights and understanding of the user in mind we drafted a problem statement and hypothesis.</p>
                <h5 class="fst-italic mb-3">Problem Statement</h5>
                <p>Individuals between the ages of 25 and 40 do not often redesign an entire room because it's difficult to mentally visualize a better layout. Additionally, experimenting with new ideas takes a great deal of effort as it usually involves moving furniture around in a crowded space. As a result, people often just accumulate objects over time and place them where they fit. The resulting layout does not always meet their needs or make them happy.</p>
                <h5 class="fst-italic mb-3">Hypothesis</h5>
                <p>We believe that creating a website that allows people to design their spaces virtually using renderings of real-world objects and spaces will make it easier for them to create spaces that meet their needs.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">What's the Solution?</h3>
                <p>Now we began brainstorming exactly how we would execute this hypothesis and solve the user's problem. Together, we created a “I like, I wish, What if” analysis to show what we know the user likes, what they wish they had that could provide immediate improvements to the user, and some possibilities that could be implimented in future iterations that may also provide value to our user.</p>
                <figure class="figure py-3 py-md-5 mx-md-5">

                </figure>
                <p>Once we had some ideas for what we wanted to include in our product, our team put together a user flow outlining the steps the user would take navigating our product and we began drafting sketches of how each page would look.</p>

                </div>
                <p>After we discussed our sketches and made a decision on the basic layout of the site, I began designing a low-fidelity prototype using Figma.</p>
                <div class="row py-3 py-md-5">
                    <figure class="figure col-md-4">

                    <figure class="figure col-md-4">

                    <figure class="figure col-md-4">
                        <img src="images/room-shui-case-study/lofi_styles.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="...">
                        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-end">Styles</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <h5 class="fst-italic mb-3">Usability Testing of the Prototype</h5>
                <p>Once the low-fidelity prototype was complete, our team began usabiltiy testing with a handful of users. The objective of this testing was to identity any issues users may have with navigating to the room design page, starting a new room design from a template, and creating an account to save the created room.</p>
                <p> Based on this round of testing, we learned that our users liked the overall interface and the process of starting to designa room, especially that they could start with a template if they didn't know the dimensions. However, some users did not immediately notice the new room button and were unsure how to start their first room.</p>
                <h5 class="fst-italic mb-3">Visual Design</h5>
                <p>At the same time, we began thinking of what style elements we wanted to include in our final design. We created a style guide to summarize many of our design choices to incorporate into our final high-fidelity protype. For our colors, we chose a sage green primary color, a salmon secondary color, and a light peach tertiary color, as well as black, white, and a light grey. We chose these main colors because we felt that they were homey and inviting, which are some of the feelings we hope that our product will allow users to acheive in their own spaces.</p>
                <figure class="figure py-3 py-md-5 mx-md-5">
                    <img src="images/room-shui-case-study/style_guide.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="...">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-end">Style Guide</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <h5 class="fst-italic mb-3">Final Designs</h5>
                <p>When it came to incorporating our style guide into our high-fidelity prototype, we had some decisions to make. One of the first one decisions was how some of our main colors would be placed on the site. We created two prototypes of the home page; one with our salmon color in the footer and our sage color for primary buttons, and another with the colors reversed. Based on some quick A/B testing we concluded that option B was the right one for our design because the green footer didn't feel as distracting to the user and the brighter salmon color on the button stood out more, drawing attention where we wanted it.</p>

                    <figure class="figure col-md-6">

                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>Another change that we considered was  making the pages where user input was required, such as the login  and add room screens, modals instead of full pages that the user would be taken to. Our theory was that this would help the user maintain a sense of where they were in the site and not feel like they lost the location they were at previously.</p>

                </div>
                <p>At this point, we conducted a final round of usability testing and some things our testers said were that they liked our use of color, found the navigation to be intuitive, and liked our use of modals. This was great news and meant that we could finally move on to developing the design.</p>
