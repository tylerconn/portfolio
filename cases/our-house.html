                <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">Who's the User?</h3>
                <p>When first began to think about who the user that we wanted to focus on for this project was, we discussed who we thought would be the two main users of the existing website, those seeking help and those seeking to volunteer or donate. We believed that this website would serve as the primary, and possibly only way, for those seeking to give back to learn more about this organization and get matched with opportunities	for them to contribute, while those in need of assistance may not have access to internet and would more likely find help through the programs this organization runs in their local communities.</p>
                <p>In order to create a user persona for this type of user, we conducted a series of interviews. Some of the things we were hoping to learn from our interviewees were how frequently they volunteered, what was preventing them from volunteering more, and how they chose which causes they support. We collected the insights gained in these interviews and organized them into an affinity diagram to show common themes.</p>
                <figure class="figure py-3 py-md-5 mx-md-5">
                    <img src="images/our-house-case-study/affinity.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="...">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-end">Affinity Diagram</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Based on some of these insights, we developed a persona named Jane Voorhees.</p>
                <figure class="figure py-3 py-md-5 mx-md-5">
                    <img src="images/our-house-case-study/user_persona.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="...">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-end">User Persona</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>To help us empathize further with Jane, we create a storyboard of their experience searching for volunteering opportunities and finding Our House where they are able to find the information and opportunities they are looking for.</p>

            <section class="mb-5">
                <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">What's the Problem?</h3>
                <p>Now that we had an understanding of our user, Jane, and their needs, we began evaluating the current website to determine if there were any things that we could change to improve Jane's experience. Based on the insights we gained during our interviews, we came up with the follow problem and hypothesis.</p>
                <h5 class="fst-italic mb-3">Problem Statement</h5>
                <p>Jane is eager to make a meaningful impact on their community but doesn't know how their skills can best be utilized or what opportunities would work with their schedule.</p>
                <h5 class="fst-italic mb-3">Hypothesis</h5>
                <p>We believe that redesigning Our House's website to have a more streamlined design and updated navigation will help increase website traffic, and donation and volunteer numbers.</p>
                <p>We know this because volunteers and donors are eager to offer their help but can feel indifferent due to the website's sterile design and disingenuous imagery.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="mb-5">
                <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">What's the Solution?</h3>
                <p>With this hypothesis in mind, we began brainstorming different ideas of how to address the problem with our design. As a team we listed potential features and grouped them based on whether they were something in the current design that our user would like, whether they were something that our user wished was added, and whether they were something that our user would like but may not be possible at the moment.</p>

                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-end">I Like, I Wish, What if</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Using these insights and this user wish-list we designed a sitemap for the website with seven primary navigation categories that we believe would be most useful for our target user, Jane. The first item is the About category where Jane could learn more about the organization and its history to ensure it aligns with their values. The Programs category provides detailed information on all the programs offered by the organization. There is also an opportunity for anyone seeking help to find it via the Get Help item. The Get Involved tab has specific information for those seeking to help. Finally, there is a News tab for anyone seeking updates and a Contact button were anyone visiting the site could get more information if needed.</p>

                <h5 class="fst-italic mb-3">Wireframing</h5>
                <p>We began the wireframing process by each sketching out some ideas for how the pages could be structured.</p>

                <p>After discussing our sketches as a team, we decided we liked having the two cards on the home page for getting involved and getting help, as well as having the the mission statement of the organization, because it was very easy for visitors of the site to see exactly was this organization is trying to accomplish and that they can either receive help or contribute.</p>
                <p>Once we settled on that plan, I began creating a low-fidelity Figma prototype of the home page and several other pages that we wanted to highlight.</p>

                        <p>For the mobile screens, we decided the keep the design elements consistent with how it was presented on larger screens, except the cards are stacked instead of horizontal and the primary navigation is now within a menu button. We decided to keep the Donate button separate from the menu dropdown, however, because we believed it was important for users, seeking to quickly make a contribution, find it easily, and the organization would definitely benefit from more contributions.</p>

                <p>Once our Figma prototype was complete we asked a few volunteers to try to navigate through the site in the hope that we could identify and usability issues before we moved to our final design. Overall the feedback was positive and users were able to effectively navigate through the site and accomplish their tasks.</p>
                <h5 class="fst-italic mb-3">UI Design</h5>
                <p>Now that we had a functioning prototype and were comfortable with the structure of the website, we began putting together a style guide that we could apply to our design when we converted our low-fidelity prototype to high-fidelity. We kept a few of the design elements that we liked from the original site, such as the primary blue color, as well as some of the secondary colors, but not all of them because we thought there were too many in the original design and it didn't feel cohesive. We also changed some of the iconography from the original site. For example, we changed the upward arrow used for family services to an icon that depicts several humans of varying sized because we thought it was more easily understood.</p>

To help create this distinction, we decided to ad a subtle drop-shadow below the navigation bar.</p>

                <p>Another change we considered from our initial designs was the FAQ section on the volunteer page. Our original design had all the questions and answers visible as all times, but we began to think that felt cluttered and overwhelming. So we created a new version where all the questions were displayed but the answers were hidden until the user expanded the question.</p>
                <p>To make sure this change was actually beneficial to our user, we conducted A/B testing and the unanimous feedback we received was that the accordion version of the FAQ section was the easiest to use.</p>
