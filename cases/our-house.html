                    <p>Throughout the project, we learned the importance of user research in understanding the needs and pain points of the target audience. Iterative design and usability testing were crucial in refining the prototype and addressing user concerns. Feedback from users during the A/B testing of the FAQ section informed our decision to adopt an accordion-style design, which was found to be more user-friendly.</p>
