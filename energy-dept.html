                    <p>With these insights in mind, I mapped out the steps it would take the user to find information on an energy saving guide and information on alternative fuels. The resulting flow includes navigating 6 pages, sometimes via hyperlinks buried in the page, with three different primary navigation bars. At this point, the primary problem that I needed to solve for the user became clear.</p>

                    <p>Once I had settled on the new information architecture for the site, I began creating a low-fidelity prototype in Figma. In addition to updating the navigation, I changed the home page to better reflect some of the desires and needs of the user, Thomas.</p>

                <div class="grid-item case-sec-text">
                    <p>The first change was adding a large hero carousel to showcase the most relevant and recent articles related to the work of the department. Below the hero, I created two columns: one with cards linking to articles explaining key department priorities and another with a feed of news and blog posts.</p>

                <div class="grid-item case-sec-text">
                    <p>Next, I began working on a style guide to develop my low-fidelity prototype into a high-fidelity prototype. When choosing my color palette, I decided to keep a few of the main colors (green, blue, gold) from the original site because my goal for this project was not to completely redefine the branding of the government agency and these colors have been long associated with the agency. I also felt that the green would make a great primary color for the site because it associated well with the agency's efforts to promote clean and green energy alternatives.</p>

                <div class="grid-item case-sec-text">
                    <p>Once I had the style guide finalized, I incorporated it into my low-fidelity prototype and cleaned up the design to create a new high-fidelity prototype.</p>

                <div class="grid-item case-sec-text">
                    <p>Finally, I tested my high-fidelity prototype for usability with a small group of potential users. The focus of this testing was similar to the testing I did at the very beginning of my project, only now it was using my prototype. I primarily asked the users to attempt two tasks that previous testing showed users having difficulty with, which were: finding information and incentives for alternative fuel vehicles, as well as finding recourses that would help them reduce home energy consumption and costs.</p>

                    <p>The outcome of this project, according to my testing, is that users are now able to better understand what this website can be used for, what the department is currently prioritizing and working on, and how they can easily find the information they are looking for when visiting this site.</p>
