                    <p>The goal of this project was to evaluate an existing government website, identify any problems with the user experience, and redesign the website to address these problems.</p>

                <h3>Who's the User?</h3>
                <p>In order to begin understanding how this website could be improved for the user, I started by trying to understand potential users of the site. I first created a proto-persona named Thomas Patterson. Thomas is a 30 year old software developer that owns a home in Atlanta. He wants to learn about renewable energy options, how to lower his energy costs, and how the government is working to address the climate crisis. However, he doesn't know where to start when looking for this information and his initial attempts at using this website were confusing.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>What's the Problem?</h3>
                <p>Next, I interviewed 3 users to help determine what pain points they might encounter while using the site. Some insights that I gained from these users were: the mission and priorities of this department and the overall purpose of this site was not immediately clear; the terms used in the navigation were not intuitive or easy to understand; the navigation was not consistent throughout the site; and the information useful to the user about energy savings was buried deep in the site.</p>
                <p>I then created a user flow of the website outlining the steps it took users to find specific pages that they would find useful and how they would navigate to them. In order to find information on saving energy in your home, users would have to navigate through three pages, expand a secondary navigation, scroll to the bottom of the page, and download a pdf via a hyperlink. In order to the find information alternative fuels for vehicles and what incentives there were for switching to a cleaner fuel, the user would have to navigate through six pages by way of hyperlinks and three different primary navigation bars. So it became apparent that information architecture could be vastly improved. I also redlined the site and performed heuristic evaluation noting some of the same issues that were previously identified with the navigation, as well as some issues with inaccessible color combinations.</p>

                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-end">User Flow</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Based on these observations, I determined that energy and climate-conscious consumers need a convenient source of information to help them reduce their energy costs and impact on the climate. However, they are currently unable to easily find this information or understand the purpose of the website.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>What's the Solution?</h3>
                <p>With this problem in mind, I hypothesized that if the current website was reorganized to make the information that users are looking for more easily and intuitively accessible, they would be able to save money and reduce their energy consumption. As such, I began focusing on how the information architecture could be improved upon. To do this, I made an inventory of every primary and secondary navigation item on the site, mixed theme up, and resorted them into groups that I thought shared a similarities and I would expect to find together if I was using the site. Once I had finished sorting these items, I settled on five categories that I felt should make up the primary navigation. These included Our Roles, which included the core functions of the department, Learn About Energy, which included general information about different types and sources of energy, Businesses, which included resources that pertained mainly to companies, Homeowners, which included resources for home energy use, and Vehicles, which includes resources for vehicle owners or shoppers. I then used these groups to prepare a site map that included primary and secondary navigation, as well as the footer.</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-md-7">
                        <figure class="figure">

                            <figcaption class="figure-caption">After Sorting</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-5">
                        <figure class="figure">
                            <img src="images/energy-case-study/sitemap.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="...">
                            <figcaption class="figure-caption">Sitemap</figcaption>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Now that I had my idea for the navigation and site map complete, I set about creating a low-fidelity prototype In Figma in order to do some usability testing on this new navigation. Secondary navigation items are accessible via a dropdown under each primary navigation item. On the home page I decided to include a main hero image that cycled between some of the most recent and important article that the department is trying to promote. Under the hero, I created two columns of cards. The larger column included cards with information on articles about some of the main priorities for the department that don't change frequently. The more narrow column included a feed of news and blog posts that are updated frequently. This columns is more narrow and on the right side, reducing it's prominence on the home page because users indicated that this would not be something they would typically be looking for when visiting the site, but I still included it on the home page because users also indicated that occasionally it would be helpful to be able to view timely updates and they would expect to find some thing like that on the homepage. Upon clicking each primary navigation item, the user is taken to a page with a column of article cards in the center and a secondary navigation to the left.</p>
                <p>To make sure my design is responsive, I also made a prototype of the site with dimensions of a mobile device where all the cards on the homepage are stacked vertically in once columns with the hero on top, the department priorities in the middle and the news and blog posts at the bottom, which reflects the order of their importance based on my testing.</p>
                <figure class="figure">
                    <img src="images/energy-case-study/lo-fi_wireframes.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="...">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Low-Fidelity Wireframes</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Next, I performed some usability testing of my low-fidelity prototype with a handful of users and results were positive. The overall feedback I received from the testers was that the navigation and layout of the homepage were easy to understand and they had a good idea of the things they could find on this site.</p>
                <p>I then began working on a style guide to develop my low-fidelity prototype into a high-fidelity prototype. When choosing my color palette, I decided to keep a few of the main colors (green, blue, gold) from the original site because my goal for this project was not to completely redefine the branding of the government agency and these colors have been long associated with the agency. I also felt that the green would make a great primary color for the site because it associated well with the agency's efforts to promote clean and green energy alternatives.</p>
                <figure class="figure">
                    <img src="images/energy-case-study/style_guide.png" class="figure-img img-fluid" alt="...">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-end">Style Guide</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Finally I began creating my high-fidelity prototype by incorporating my style guide into my low-fidelity prototype and making a few adjustments to the clean up the design. I increased the size of the carousel image on the home page to fit the screen better and removed the secondary navigation box from the left side of the page because it was duplicating the dropdown on the primary navigation and redundant. I also expanded the dropdown from the primary navigation to be a solid green box that spanned the page to create separation between navigation and the content of the page.</p>
